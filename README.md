# BouncyBall
 
The Bouncy Ball program was inspired by the popular game Flappy Bird for mobile apps. This was my first attempt at making a game, and I knew I wanted to make a game I would enjoy playing. That is where the idea came from. I found a tutorial on youtube for how to
make a flappy bird like game using javascript and so that is where I learned how to do it.
From the tutorial I made my own adjustments and modifacations to make the game how I wanted it to be.  
{Describe your purpose for writing this software.}

The purpose of this sotfwatrr is to be a fun easy game for people to play.
